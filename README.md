### Hi there and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Brian Miller, a data scientist based out of Denver, Colorado. I'm currently an analyst for Boston Scientific and have been working in analytics full time for four years. Driven by a genuine passion for continuous learning and problem-solving, I excel in sifting through substantial data sets and crafting machine learning models to enhance business decision-making. I have experience in:  
* Python, SQL, R, Bash
* Machine Learning
* Bioinformatics

My journey into data science started during my college years. Intrigued by bioinformatics, I joined a research lab where I played a pivotal role in setting up the lab's computational pipeline that analyzes genetic expression sequencing data. I then joined the genetics division of the OHSU hospital, where I collaborated with post-docs to identify rare genetic mutations within the human population. Through these experiences, I discovered my interest in learning new technologies and delving into predictive analytics, which steered me towards getting my masters in Data Science.

When I am not working or learning new technologies, I am usually at the gym, in the mountains, camping, or snowboarding. I grew up internationally before I moved back to the US for college, so I try to keep up my spanish whenever I can! 

I place great value on teamwork, collaboration, and the sense of camaraderie that comes with it. If you are looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
