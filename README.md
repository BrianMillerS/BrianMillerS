### Hi there and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Brian Miller a data scientist based out of Denver, Colorado. I am currently am an analyst for Boston Scientific and have been working in analytics full time for four years. Driven by a genuine passion for continuous learning and problem-solving, I excel in sifting through substantial data sets and crafting machine learning models to enhance business decision-making. I have experience in:
Python
SQL
Machine Learning
Computer Vision
Data Visualization
Bioinformatics

My journey in data science commenced during my college years. Intrigued by bioinformatics, I became part of a research lab, where I played a pivotal role in setting up the lab's computational pipeline for analysing genetic expression sequencing data :test_tube:. This path led me to the genetics division of a hospital, where I collaborated extensively with post-doctoral researchers in identifying rare genetic mutations within the human population :dna::microscope:. Through these experiences I discovered a profound interest in learning new technologies and delving into predictive anlaytics, which naturally steered me towards a fulfilling career in data science.

When I am not working or learning new technolgies I am usually at the gym :muscle: or in the mountains backpacking :tent: or snowboarding :snowboarder:. I grew up internationally :jp: :it: :thailand: :argentina: before I moved home to the US for college, so I also try to keep up my spanish whenever I can. 

I place great value on teamwork, relishing collaboration and the sense of camaraderie that comes with it. If you are looking to collaborate, free to reach out!
