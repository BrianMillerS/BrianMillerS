### Hi there and welcome to my profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am Brian Miller, a data scientist based out of Denver, Colorado. I am currently an analyst for Boston Scientific and have been working in analytics full time for four years. Driven by a genuine passion for continuous learning and problem-solving, I excel in sifting through substantial data sets and crafting machine learning models to enhance business decision-making. I have experience in:  
* Python, SQL, R, Bash
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Bioinformatics

My journey in data science started during my college years. Intrigued by bioinformatics, I joined a research lab, where I played a pivotal role in setting up the lab's computational pipeline for analyzing genetic expression sequencing data :test_tube: This led me to join the genetics division of a hospital, where I collaborated with post-docs to identify rare genetic mutations within the human population :dna: :microscope:. Through these experiences I discovered my interest in learning new technologies and delving into predictive analytics, which steered me towards getting my masters in data science.

When I am not working or learning new technologies I am usually at the gym :muscle: in the mountains camping :tent: or snowboarding :snowboarder: I grew up internationally :jp: :it: :thailand: :argentina: before I moved home to the US for college, so I also try to keep up my spanish whenever I can. 

I place great value on teamwork, relishing collaboration and the sense of camaraderie that comes with it. If you are looking to collaborate, feel free to reach out!
